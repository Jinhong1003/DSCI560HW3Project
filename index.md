MyWonder for big data analytics and visualization
## 1.Project summary
MyWonder is a new platform that perform an analysis of big data and visualization.    

At the moment, data analysis is extremely time consuming, it is common to spend several hours to have a visualization based on big data. As a result, our work may not be accomplished on time, this may cause a really great economic damage.   

MyWonder will overcome these shortcomings by distributing the files on the cloud which is really efficient so that users can save lots of time. 

This solution of MyWonder is very good because it can reduce the processing time from hours in 10 minutes, what is more, MyWonder is a really useful platform due to the fact that users can calculate their analytic and summaries from their phones very easily and it only takes a very short time.   
## 2. Three wastes in Project
a.	Waiting

when CEO have a meeting with clients , if he/she don’t understand things of our platform, he/she would call our customer assistance team constantly, this will cost a lot of time not only for CEO but for our customers and CEO cannot quickly change contents before demo. 

b. Transport/Waiting: 

There are too many unnecessary intermediate links，when users give the team some advices and want to have an update, they have to talk with customer support and then customer support talked to the designers, who then met with the developers, finally,  the backend team updating contents.

c. Skills

Users cannot understand the terminology and contents used in the user interface.
## 3. Deliverables
a. Original platform submission
b. Powerpoint submission
c. Release the October version of the platform 

## 4. Milestone
a. Setting a person who can change the content directly
b. Simplify the terminology and contents used in the user interface
c. Separating testing and production environment 
d. Setting an area to put a “Note” in our visualizations
